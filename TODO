*** Implement AuthPreferneces Functionality
    - QBXMLRP2Lib.AuthPreferences needs a COM this pointer???

*** Implement filtered queries

*** Fix Non-Working Requests

*** Fix attributes (iterator, iteratorID)

*** Error Checking to prevent incompatible filters from being applied at the same time

*** Turn all Queries into a dict that has a value relating to its usage/workingness
        and match for that item when submitted into a currently non existent query run function

*** Why does warning give verbatim text instead of formatting the string with the variable

*** Check to see if setup.py works

*** When building report query attribute setters, add ".*ReportType" tag. see page 98

*** Utilize a validator method to check requests before they are submitted
